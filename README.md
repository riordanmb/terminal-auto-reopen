## Usage

### Basic Usage

The extension works automatically once installed. When you close your last terminal, a new one will be opened with the same configuration.

### Status Bar

- Toggle Auto-reopen

### Commands

Access these commands through the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- `Terminal Auto-reopen: Toggle` - Enable/disable automatic reopening
- `Terminal Auto-reopen: Show Menu` - Display quick actions menu
- `Terminal Auto-reopen: Restore from History` - Choose a previous terminal configuration
- `Terminal Auto-reopen: Clear History` - Reset terminal history
- `Terminal Auto-reopen: Open Settings` - Configure extension settings

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can assign keyboard shortcuts to any command in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

Example keybindings.json entry:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+k ctrl+t",
    "command": "terminalReopen.showMenu"
}
```

## Configuration

Access settings through VS Code's Settings UI or settings.json:

```json
{
    "terminalReopen.enabled": true,                 // Enable/disable auto-reopen
    "terminalReopen.preserveState": true,           // Keep terminal configurations
    "terminalReopen.showStatusBar": true,           // Show status bar indicator
    "terminalReopen.reopenDelay": 1000,             // Delay before reopening (ms)
    "terminalReopen.trackCommands": true,           // Track last command
    "terminalReopen.restoreLastCommand": false,     // Auto-execute last command
    "terminalReopen.maxHistorySize": 5              // Number of configurations to remember
}
```

## Features in Detail

### Terminal State Preservation

The extension preserves:

- Working directory (CWD)
- Shell type
- Environment variables
- Terminal name
- Last executed command (optional)

### History Management

- Maintains a configurable number of recent terminal configurations
- Persists across VS Code sessions
- Quick restore through command palette or status bar menu
- Clear history option for fresh start

### Visual Feedback

- Different status bar icons for enabled/disabled states

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Terminal doesn't reopen automatically**
   - Check if the extension is enabled in settings
   - Verify the reopenDelay setting isn't too high
   - Ensure VS Code has necessary permissions

2. **Working directory not preserved**
   - Some shell types may not support CWD preservation
   - Try using absolute paths in terminal commands

3. **Last command not tracked**
   - Verify trackCommands is enabled in settings
   - Some shell types may not support command tracking
